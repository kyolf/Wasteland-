# Wasteland
by Nick Jones, Jamie Wang, Paton Vinal, Kyle Szeto <br/>

## Production App
http://wasteland-adventure.herokuapp.com/

## Description
We made this game because we were passionate gamers and were motivated to make a game. We also believe that making a game is a good way to learn programming. The objective of the game is shown below.

## Objective of Game
The character is trying to avoid monsters in order to escape the wasteland. This may sound easy, but there is a catch! The character will need to collect batteries for his flashlight in order to see through the dark creepy wasteland.

## Technology Used
**FrontEnd**: HTML, Phaser, Javascript <br/>
**BackEnd**: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mlab <br/>
**Deployment**: Heroku <br/>

## Things to Look Into For Future of the Game
* Fix Bat Animation when it hits the end of the screen.
* Look more into the Phaser problem when the velocity of the character is too high!
* Add more animations to the sprites such as ducking
* Add powerups 

**Note** The sprites and music in the `static` folder will be used in the future!

## Documentation of API
* **GET** http://wasteland-adventure.herokuapp.com/api/topScores <br/>
  * This allows you to get the top 10 highscores in sorted order from the database <br/>
  * This is used to display the top 10 highscores in sorted order on the highscores page </br>
* **POST** http://wasteland-adventure.herokuapp.com/api/topScores <br/>
  * If there are 10 or more entries in the database, the POST will allow you to remove the lowest score from the top 10 highscores and allow you to add the new highscore to the database. <br/>
  * If there are less than 10 entries in the database, the POST will allow you to add the new highscore to the database.
  * This is used in the Victory and GameOver Page when your score is higher than the current lowest score from the top 10 highscore list. </br>

## How to Use our code
* Fork it to your Repo
* Git clone the Repo link
* Move into the project directory: `cd ~/YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECTORY/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`
* Make sure you do a `npm install` in the server folder before doing anything
* Run `npm run dev` in order to build the production app
* Type `localhost:8080` in your web browser and it should up and running locally.

**Note** You will need to close the current server that is running and run `npm run dev` everytime you make a change. <br/>
